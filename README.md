# Financial-Consumer-Complaint
Consumer complaints on financial products & services for Bank of America from 2017 to 2023,
including the dates the complaint was submitted to the CFPB and then sent to the company,
the product and issue mentioned in the complaint, and the company's response.

## Objective

## Insights
1. Yes, from my findings, July and August have the most complaints,
   as the years 2022 and 2023 have lots of complaints.
2.  Products with the most complaints are checking and savings accounts
   and the most common issue is managing the account.
3. Complaints are mostly closed with an explanation
4. Untimely responses may correlate with higher  customer dissatisfaction.

## Recommendation
1. I suggest you add temporary support staff or self-service tools during peak times
2. Launch product-specific education campaigns or service audits
3. Respond to all consumer complaints within 2 business days to avoid distrust.
4. Train agents  to communicate clearly to customers why a complaint was accepted or rejected
